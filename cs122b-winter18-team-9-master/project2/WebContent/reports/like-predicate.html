	<h1>We used the LIKE-predicate in queries when searching and browsing.
	For search, we used LIKE if the user specified a substring for movie title and actor.
	We felt that this made sense because sometimes the user doesn't know the full movie title or actor's name.
	We also used LIKE when browsing by name. For example, "A%" would be useful for finding all moves that start
	with the letter "A".</h1>
