	In our XML parsing, we used two different optimization techniques.
	(1) First we used HashMaps instead of Lists to reduce the amount of time it takes
		to get the correct value we were searching for, instead of iterating the entire list.
		One HashMap used the film's id as the key and a Movie class object as the value. The Second HashMap
		used the film's id as the key and a StarInMoive class object as the value. The last HashMap used
		the actor's name as the key and Actor class object as the value. Each class object stored information
		regarding our databases' table attributes which were accessible by getter methods.
		
	(2) The second optimization was the use of batch insert. It decreased the time it takes to insert our
		data. Without batch insert, you would have to insert records one row at a time and each time
		opening and closing a database connection. With batch insert, we were able to insert multiple
		records at once. We also used prepared statements so that we didn't have to recreate the query over
		and over again.

		Using these optimizations, we were able to significantly improve our programs runtime. 
		Our runtime after our optimizations was around 10 seconds. This is minutes faster than running 
		without any optimizations.
